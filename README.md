# Reinforcement Learning Foundation

This repository contains my personal learning notes and practice code for reinforcement learning, based on the book **"PyTorch 1.x Reinforcement Learning Cookbook"**. All code is handwritten by me while following the book, aiming to build a solid foundation in reinforcement learning.

## ðŸ“š Reference

- **Book**: *PyTorch 1.x Reinforcement Learning Cookbook*
- **Framework**: This project mainly uses `gym` for environments, along with common Python libraries such as `numpy`, `pygame`, and `matplotlib`.

## ðŸ’» Environment Setup

It is recommended to use `conda` to create an isolated environment:

```bash
conda create -n my_env python==3.11.5
conda activate my_env

pip install gym # 0.26.2
pip install numpy==1.23.5
pip install pygame # 2.6.1
pip install matplotlib  # if you want to draw plots
```

## âœ¨ Notes
This project is for educational and personal learning purposes only.

All code is written manually for better understanding and reinforcement of key concepts.
